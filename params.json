The JavaScript is readable not minified and contains no\r\nXMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX). The benefit of this technique is you can load the \r\nJavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being \r\nloaded. \r\n\r\nHere is a link to the BitcoinTalk.org forum topic discussing this project:\r\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=43496.0\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease send DONATIONS for this project to Bitcoin Address: \r\n1NiNja1bUmhSoTXozBRBEtR8LeF9TGbZBN\r\n\r\n\r\nEND USER NOTES: \r\n 1) To print QRCode in IE8 you must enable the \"Print Background Colors and \r\n    Images\" checkbox on the \"Page Setup\" screen.\r\n 2) For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.\r\n 3) Requires IE8+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.\r\n 4) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.\r\n    Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.\r\n 5) DO NOT use Opera Mini it renders JavaScript output server side, therefore\r\n    they might record the private key you generated.\r\n 6) Art Wallet does not work properly in IE8 due to CSS limitations.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice of Copyrights and Licenses:\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nThe liteaddress.org project, software and embedded resources are copyright liteaddress.org. \r\nThe liteaddress.org name and logo are not part of the open source license.\r\n\r\nPortions of the all-in-one HTML document contain JavaScript codes that are the copyrights \r\nof others.
