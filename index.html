JavaScript Client-Side Litecoin Wallet Generator</p>

<p>Now Litecoin addresses and their corresponding private key can be conveniently 
generated in a web browser.</p>

<p>The liteaddress.org project is a fork of the bitaddress.org project located at:
<a href="https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org">https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org</a></p>

<p>The liteaddress.org project provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded
JavaScript/Css/Images. The JavaScript is readable not minified and contains no
XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX). The benefit of this technique is you can load the 
JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being 
loaded. </p>

<p>Here is a link to the BitcoinTalk.org forum topic discussing this project:

<p>END USER NOTES: 
 1) To print QRCode in IE8 you must enable the "Print Background Colors and 
    Images" checkbox on the "Page Setup" screen.
 2) For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.
 3) Requires IE8+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.
 4) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.
    Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.
 5) DO NOT use Opera Mini it renders JavaScript output server side, therefore
    they might record the private key you generated.
 6) Art Wallet does not work properly in IE8 due to CSS limitations.</p>
